            <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8 text-gray-600">Hey, my name is Esteban. Like most people, I wasn't born into wealth or this profession. I started in the medical field at the lower end of the pay scale, initially making $12.40 an hour. Over time, I built a reputation for myself in the medical field, taking on numerous travel contracts with federal and state entities.</p>
            <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">Eventually, I found a way to bridge the gap between my medical knowledge and real estate investing. When I first heard about wholesaling, I closed a handful of deals and then decided to focus on buying and building my rental portfolio to create passive income and buy back my time.</p>
            <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">My goal is to help anyone who feels like they don't know how to get started. If you're just like me and need help, we provide everything from start to finish. In our Discord, you'll find a lot of free resources to go from zero to hero</p>
